# Calorie Counter Web App 🐙

This repository contains the source code for a calorie counter application built using web technologies. The app is designed to help users track their daily calorie intake by providing a form to input food items and their corresponding calorie information. I create this project to learn how to work with forms in HTML and JavaScript. And I learned so many new things.

### Features
*  Form-based input: Users can enter the name and calorie information for each food item consumed.
*  Calorie calculation: The app calculates the total calorie intake based on the user's input.
  
### Technologies Used
*  HTML: Provides the structure and content of the web page.
*  CSS: Styles the visual appearance of the elements on the page.
*  JavaScript: Enables interactivity and functionalities within the app (e.g., form validation, calculations).

#### What I Learned?
*   Different types of form validation (e.g., required fields, data type checks)
*   Techniques for handling user input errors
*   Best practices for designing user-friendly forms
*   NodeLists
*   Regular expressions (Regex) ❗
*   Deep understanding of creating forms.
*   New methods (e.g. -> .insertAdjacentHTML() - .preventDefault() etc.)
*   for...of loops
*   And many other things
